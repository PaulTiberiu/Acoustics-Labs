# Acoustics-Labs
Here are some labs that I have coded in python for my Acoustics course LU3ME105 at Sorbonne Universit√©.

## TP1 - Digital signal modeling
This lab consists in creating and observing the dispertion of signals. When a wave propagates without attenuation, the spectrum of the signal carried by the wave does not vary in amplitude, but it's phase is shifted by a value which depends on the speed of the wave and the distance traveled.

## TP2 - Ultrasound
The objective of this lab is then to analyze signals in reflection in order to determine the compressibility and the density of the probed material.

## TP3 - Propagation of acoustic waves
The objective of this lab is to model the propagation of acoustic waves in a multilayer medium with variable section.
